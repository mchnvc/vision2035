# Machine Ventures Vision 2035

We are witnessing a remarkable and enduring transformation - from where we program machines to where we teach them to learn and adapt independently. This shift to machine intelligence will inject $13 trillion into the global economy over the next decade and serve as a force-multiplier for humanity, unlocking unprecedented possibilities.

As a firm at the forefront of machine intelligence, we recognize that by anticipating the "status quo" of more than a decade from now - rather than simply reacting to the present - we will be better equipped to identify and support startups that will yield significant returns for our investors while shaping a future of abundance.

To crystallize our perspective, we present Vision 2035, a blueprint that guides our investment strategy. By sharing this roadmap with you, we aim to provide clarity on our long-term objectives and how they will contribute to creating value across multiple funds and for society as a whole. Some key elements from our vision:

+A ‘singularity’, or moment when machines will outperform humans collectively, will not only be achieved but within about a decade (our estimation is by 2035).
+It will be emergent (suddenly reached) rather than targeted through dedicated development.
+It will be done via specialization of AI and machine intelligence, rather than generalization (AGI) as is widely believed.
+Machine intelligence, consisting of machine: learning, production, perception, and reasoning; will be the key driver of specialization.
+It is our hypothesis that these interwoven capabilities have the potential to create a new order of magnitude in both efficiency (10x) and effectiveness (10x) leading to an increase of 100 times more value and at greater speed.
+Specific domains will benefit more quickly than others. We believe these are Workforce (people/productivity), Industry (manufacturing & logistics) and Infrastructure (next generation data, compute, etc).
+Three elements will be critical to value creation in these domains: i) the development of open stack technologies, ii) the role of data, and iii) the use of collective intelligence.
+Machine intelligence will accelerate various economic and political issues, allowing targeted venture capital to capitalize on them.
+Recognizing and investing in specialization requires specialized knowledge, coupled with generalist experience to understand the breadth of the impact these technologies will have.

We invite you to collaborate with us in shaping the emergent singularity and capturing its significant value. Your shared enthusiasm for this endeavor is appreciated, and we encourage you to join us through active engagement and support as we embark on a collective journey toward a future of abundance enabled by machine intelligence.
